            <p id="materials-p">Up until recently, the scientific consensus was that the asteroid Psyche consisted mostly of metal.
                <br><br>
                The more recent data indicates that the asteroid is possibly a mix of metal and silicate, the same 
                material found in glass and sand. 
                <br><br>
                The best analysis indicates that Psyche is likely made of a 
                mixture of rock and metal, with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume.

            <p id="features-p">Scientists, through the combining of radar and optical observations, have generated a 3D model of Psyche,
                which is believed to have two craterlike depressions, and suggests that there may be significant 
                variations in the metal content and color of the asteroid over its surface. 
                <br><br>
                Until the satellite, also named Psyche, begins its mission to see the asteroid Psyche up close for the 
                first time, we donâ€™t know what it actually looks like.

                    <br><br>
                Psyche is approximately 144 miles / 232 kilometers at its tallest point
                    <br><br>
                Psyche's approximately the same size as the state of Maryland in the United States

                Psyche is slightly longer and slightly slimmer than Switzerland, however is larger 
                when compared to square miles/kilometers.

            <h4 class="comparable-h4" id="h4-1">Area measurements larger than 5 recognized countries</h4>
            <p class="comparable-p">
                When looking at Psyche's area, from one side, it is bigger than the countries of 
                Tuvalu, Nauru, Monaco, and the Vatican City. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="comparable-h4" id="h4-2">Surface area would make it the 92nd largest country on Earth</h4>
            <p class="comparable-p">
                If we were to look at Pscyhe's total surface area, it would be larger than 103 recognized countries, 
                including Bangladesh.
